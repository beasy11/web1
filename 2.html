  <h1>CSS란 무엇인가?</h1>

  <h1>CSS</h1>
<strong>Cascading Style Sheets <u>(CSS)</u></strong> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.
CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
<p>This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>
